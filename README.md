# [Project 1: Covid-19 Spread in US - Project Overview](https://github.com/Shivi15/Covid-19-Spread-in-US)
* Analyzed the spread and gradual shift of Covid-19 prone counties in the US.
* Found out the counties with most covid positive cases, and the highest infection rate.
* Cleaned and performed an inner merge on the two datasets, i.e. Population of each county and Covid-19 cases of these counties.
* Using tableau's racing bar charts and animation found out, only 1.04% of LA counties are infected, 3.3% of Arizona counties are infected, and New York had an alarming infection rate of 13.5%.

# [Project 2: Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Shivi15/Movie-Rec_System)
* Developed a Collaborative Filtering Recommender System. Considering only user preferences into account, and if the two users share the same interests.
* Using one-hot encoding, extracted and created a search for a movie by genres.
* Performed data cleaning before learning about the distribution of rating data.
* Implemented two modelling techniques, IBCF and UBCF. Evaluating the ROC curve and Precision-Recall curve, UBCF became the top model with 88.2% accuracy.

# [Project 3: Airbnb Data Analysis - Project Overview](https://github.com/LohithChowdary/Airbnb-Data-Analysis)
* Analyzed Airbnb listings in New York City to understand if nonstandard amenities can be added to increase the revenue.
* Cleaned and performed Exploratory Data Analysis, by implementing techniques like a word cloud, Term generation matrix, visualizing neighbourhoods with high Airbnb listings using tableau on a map and carrying out a sentimental analysis on reviews dataset draw insights.
* Created features from Amenities by performing feature engineering.
* Finally, evaluated 5 different models, and found out that XGBoost showed maximum accuracy in predicting Airbnb listings' prices.
