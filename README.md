# Project 1: Airbnb Data Analysis
* Analyzed Airbnb listings in the city of New York, to understand if nonstandard amenities can be added to increase the revenue.
* Cleaned and performed Exploratory Data Analysis, by implementing techniques like a word cloud, term generation matrix, visualizing neighbourhoods with high Airbnb listings on a map and carried out a sentimental analysis on reviews dataset to draw insights.
* Created features from Amenities, by performing feature engineering.
* Finally, evaluated 5 different models, and found out that XGBoost showed maximum accuracy in predicting the prices of Airbnb listings.

# Project 2: Movie Recommendation System
* Developed a Collaborative Filtering Recommender System. Considering only user preferences into account, and if the two users share the same interests.
* Using one-hot encoding, extracted and created a search for a movie by genres.
* Performed data cleaning before learning about the distribution of rating data.
* Implemented two modeling techniques, IBCF and UBCF. Evaluating the ROC curve and Precision-Recall curve, UBCF came out to be the top model.
